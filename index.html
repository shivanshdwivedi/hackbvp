        long way.

        The motivation behind the themes for this hackathon is the current COVID-19 situation; to prepare ourselves to

                  <p class="popups">Today, business owners are threatened by the overwhelming challenges posed by the
                    pandemic. The business sector has seen a tremendous downfall with buyers locked up at their places
                    with the uncertainty created by the pandemic looming over them. Markets have shut down, completely
                    diverting the focus of buyers towards e-commerce.
                    Minimal expenditure for just the essentials has become the new normal. Time to enjoy luxuries are
                    almost over.
                    So, with this theme, we aim to explore innovation in the field of e-commerce and business.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="carousel-item">
                  <h1 class="popup">Education</h1>
                  <p class="popups">COVID-19 has greatly affected the educational sector. Education has been hit
                    particularly hard by the pandemic, with 1.53 billion learners having to drop out of school and 184
                    country-wide school closures.
                    Therefore, continuing education through alternative learning pathways is one of the biggest concerns
                    right now, to limit the blow to education is as much as possible.
                    You can develop software/hardware that can be accessed and used by the people even in remote areas
                    to ensure that nobody has to say no to something as basic as education.
                    Educators too, face trouble while teaching online, calling for a simpler solution. Let's "Make in
                    India"!</p>

                <div class="carousel-item">
                  <h1 class="popup">HealthCare</h1>
                  <p class="popups">With the exponentially increasing impact of the virus, people in the healthcare
                    industry are required to be very cautious and supportive towards patients, having to work overtime
                    and staying away from their own families.
                    Despite their efforts, cases are rising non-stop, making it more and more difficult to arrange
                    resources for everyone, evidently putting the industry in dire need of all the assistance it can
                    get.

                  <h1 class="popup">Lifestyle</h1>
                  <p class="popups">COVID-19 has affected all spheres of life and livelihood, affecting our lifestyle
                    adversely. Not only has the danger of the disease made us more cautious, but the containment
                    measures taken in the wake of the pandemic have substantially changed our way of living. Thus, the
                    pandemic has made us shape our lives differently than before.
                    The constant need to wash hands, maintain social distancing, choose home-made food are now
                    inseparable features of our lifestyle.
                    Developing apps or devices that can detect crowded areas or places for you to avoid to ensure social
                    distancing in public places can improve the quality of life. (This is just an example, the
                    possibilities are endless!)
                    So, with this theme, we aim to explore lifestyle changes in these times of restricted mobility due
                    to COVID-19 in India.</p>

                  <h1 class="popup">Security</h1>
                  <p class="popups">The world struggling with the impact of COVID-19 appears as an opportunity for
                    cybercriminals. As countries go into lockdown mode, forcing citizens work and study at home,
                    cyber-security becomes a major issue.
                    As a consequence of this, there has been a rapid increase in cyber attacks in multiple forms,
                    ranging from ransomware attacks, remote access network, spear-phishing, secretly deploy malware etc.
                    The pandemic has created an enormous challenge for businesses worldwide: to continue operating
                    despite massive shutdowns of offices and other facilities. The technologies on which they have long
                    depended (their data centres, cloud systems, departmental servers and digital devices) have become
                    even more vital.
                    The government too, has become more dependent on digital mediums to reassure the public and maintain
                    order. It is expected to make rules, share critical information and contain the spread of
                    misinformation. They are using these digital channels to urge employers to pay salaries and the
                    public to avoid hoarding essential resources along with avoiding spreading rumours.
                    This is only a snippet of why it has become imperative to develop efficient security systems to
                    safeguard confidential data.
                    We invite innovators to create smart solutions for the same.</p>
